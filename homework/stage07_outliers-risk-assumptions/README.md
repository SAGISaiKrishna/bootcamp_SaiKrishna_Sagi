# Stage 07 – Outliers, Risk and Assumptions

## Goal
Implement reusable outlier functions, apply them to the dataset, and test how results change when outliers are removed or softened. Document thresholds, assumptions, and risks.

## Files
- `src/outliers.py` – IQR, z score, winsorizing
- `notebooks/stage07_outliers-risk-assumptions_homework.ipynb` – main analysis
- `data/raw/outliers_homework.csv` – provided or generated in notebook
- `figures/` – plots generated by the notebook
- `reports/stage07_summary_stats.csv`, `reports/stage07_model_metrics.csv` – saved outputs

## Methods
- IQR rule with k = 1.5
- Z score with threshold = 3.0
- Winsorizing at 5 percent and 95 percent

## Sensitivity
We compare three variants:
1) All data
2) IQR filtered
3) Winsorized

Metrics reported: slope, intercept, R2, MAE.
Figures include boxplots and residuals comparison.

## Reflection
Outliers can be errors, rare events, or early warnings. Filtering improves fit quality but risks deleting real tail behavior. Winsorizing preserves rows while reducing leverage. Results depend on thresholds, so sensitivity tables and plots are included.
